                <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.
                    <br>
                    It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to
                    websites. While
                    JavaScript is influenced by Java.<br>
                    JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the
                    client's web
                    browser rather than on the web server.<br>
                    This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the
                    server. <br>
                    For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the
                    required
                    fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information
                    is actually
                    transmitted to the server.</p>

                    the utility of larger frameworks.<br>
                    Skeleton only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and includes a grid, but that's often more

                    to get started.<br>
                    In fact, this site is built on Skeleton Framework and has ~200 lines of custom CSS (half of which is
